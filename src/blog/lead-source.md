Generating leads is one of the most important jobs of using a Marketing Automation tool like Dynamics Customer Insights - Journeys (previously known as Marketing). With the transition to Real Time Marketing you can now send emails to leads directly without ever having a contact 🎉 With the Form builder in Real Time Marketing, you can create attractive Lead Generation Forms.

Unfortunately, there is one flaw...

The Lead Source is not filled automatically with Landing page, like it was in Outbound Marketing.
Are you using Lead Source in your dashboards and reporting? Here are five steps to get in done!
