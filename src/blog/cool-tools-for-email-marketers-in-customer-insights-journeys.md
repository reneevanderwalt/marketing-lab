I love writing about **Dynamics Customer Insights**, but there are tools I use daily that make my life as a marketing consultant much easier! Don’t expect any AI tools here (even though I use them)—this list is all about my personal favourites from my browser bookmarks bar. 😄

> ⚠️ No affiliate links or sponsorships—just honest recommendations.

### [Litmus](https://www.litmus.com)

**Use it for:** Email testing, analytics, and rendering previews

Whenever I set up a new Customer Insights - Journeys instance—or take over an existing one—I check whether the **Litmus integration** is enabled. If not, I switch it on.

I rely on Litmus to preview how email templates look across devices, email clients, and in dark mode. With the new **email analytics** in Customer Insights, I can now tailor designs based on the most popular devices and operating systems used by recipients.

✅ Pro tip: Email clients change all the time, so test your templates regularly!

Also worth exploring: Litmus’s **code editor**, **webinars**, and **trend reports** for fresh email design ideas.

### [Really Good Emails](https://reallygoodemails.com)

**Use it for:** Design inspiration, examples, and email trends

This is my go-to when I need creative inspiration. You can search thousands of real emails (HTML included) by keyword, industry, or use case—like “welcome emails” or “abandoned cart.”

They also send a great newsletter and host feedback sessions that offer tons of valuable insights.

### [Can I Email](https://www.caniemail.com)

**Use it for:** Checking email client support for HTML/CSS features

If you’ve ever wondered, “Can I use this fancy background gradient in Gmail?”—this is your tool.

It shows which clients support specific HTML/CSS features so you can avoid rendering surprises.

🔖 Add it to your bookmarks—you’ll be glad you did.

### [VWO A/B Test Significance Calculator](https://vwo.com/tools/ab-test-significance-calculator/)

**Use it for:** Validating A/B test results

I mentioned this tool in [my blog on A/B testing](https://marketing-lab.nl/work/ab-testing-in-customer-insights-journeys), but it deserves a second shoutout. It’s an easy way to determine whether your test results are statistically significant.

Especially useful when running multiple tests—no need to guess if a winner really *won*.

### [MX Toolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com)

**Use it for:** Domain diagnostics and deliverability checks

An essential for every email marketer. You can:
- Check DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Identify blacklisting issues
- Run domain health reports

💌 Bonus: Use their [Deliverability Test](https://mxtoolbox.com/deliverability) by sending an email to `ping@tools.mxtoolbox.com`.

> ⚠️ Make sure you send from an inbox you *have access to*—that’s where the report will go (not the reply-to address).

### [ZeroBounce](https://www.zerobounce.net) (or similar tools)

**Use it for:** Validating large email lists before importing

When helping clients move to Dynamics Customer Insights - Journeys, I always recommend validating their list first. ZeroBounce gives you detailed validity results per email address.

Great for avoiding bounces and protecting sender reputation when uploading large lists.

### [Movable Ink](https://movableink.com)

**Use it for:** Dynamic, personalized email content

Not a free tool, but one of the best for **personalized visuals and content**. Think dynamic images that adapt based on customer behavior or preferences.

It’s a fantastic tool to boost engagement and drive real-time relevance.

### [Playable](https://playable.video)

**Use it for:** Gamification and interactive email elements

Playable is great for adding interactive games and experiences to your emails—like:
- Quizzes
- Puzzles
- Swipe/tap games (think Tinder-style)

You can use the data collected to enrich your CDP and tailor future journeys. Plus, their support team is one of the best I’ve worked with!

### Wrap-Up

That’s my list of go-to tools that help boost productivity, engagement, and deliverability in Dynamics Customer Insights - Journeys. I use them daily—and I keep discovering new ones!
