### Resignation Letter from Outbound Marketing

#### *Dear Marketer,*

Please accept this letter as my formal resignation from my position as Marketing Automation Specialist at your company, effective **July 1st, 2025**.

I appreciate the time we have spent working together on building segments, especially with my latest achievement—incorporating natural language. Perhaps these were the first baby steps toward what is now the well-known Co-Pilot.

I am grateful for the improvements we’ve made to the email editor. It started as a rather modest tool, where even my own colleague, Outlook, was not well accounted for. However, I leave behind a mature editor in which responsiveness, styling, and dark mode can be easily incorporated in a user-friendly way. My replacement will continue enhancing the email editor, making it even easier to create dynamic and conditional content within emails—a true game-changer, if you ask me!

I also reflect fondly on the exciting projects involving the form builder. By enabling the creation of forms not just for contacts but also with fields and lookups from any entity, I have built forms for over a hundred different scenarios—far beyond a simple contact form. I know your new colleague may have some refinements to make, but nothing is impossible!

It has been a pleasure working with you over the past years, and I will continue to do so until the end of June. I am confident that my good friend, Real-Time Journeys, is more than capable of taking over on **July 1st**!

#### *A farewell approaching soon!*
